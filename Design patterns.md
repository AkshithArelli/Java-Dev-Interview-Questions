# Design Patterns

Design patterns are general, reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design

Total: 21

Eg:

## Creational

These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable for the situation.

  - Singleton
  - Factory
  - Builder

## Structural 

These patterns focus on how classes and objects can be combined to form larger structures.

  - Proxy
  - Facade

## Behavioural

These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects, focusing on communication and interaction. 

  - Strategy
  - Template


### Singleton design pattern

Definition

Singleton ensures only one instance of a class exists in the entire application and provides a global point of access to it.

⸻

Why Use It?

	•	When you need one shared object, e.g.:
	•	Logger
	•	Cache manager
	•	Configuration reader
	•	Database connection factory

⸻

Key Features

	1.	Private constructor → prevents external object creation
	2.	Static instance → stores the single object
	3.	Public static method → returns the same instance every time

⸻

Eager Initialization (Simple but memory-heavy)

Object created at application startup (whether you use it or not).

```java
public class Singleton {

    private static final Singleton instance = new Singleton();

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
}
```
Pros

	•	Simple
	•	Thread-safe by default

Cons

	•	Instance created even when not needed
  
⸻

Lazy Initialization (Not Thread-Safe)

Object created at application startup (whether you use it or not).

```java
  public class MySingleton {
      private static MySingleton instance;

      private MySingleton() {
          // Private constructor to prevent direct instantiation
      }

      public static MySingleton getInstance() {
          if (instance == null) {
              instance = new MySingleton();
          }
          return instance;
      }
  }
```
⸻

Double-Checked Locking (Best balanced approach)

```java
public class Singleton {

    private static volatile Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```
Why this is best?

	•	Lazy-loaded
	•	Thread-safe
	•	No synchronization overhead

⸻

Pros

	•	Saves memory
	•	Ensures consistency
	•	Good for shared resources

Cons

	•	Harder to test (global state)
	•	Can violate Single Responsibility

⸻

One-Line Summary
```
Singleton = one instance + global access + controlled creation.
```

### Factory Method Pattern

✅ Definition (One Sentence)

Factory Method is a pattern where you create objects using a method, instead of calling new directly.

This allows subclasses to decide which object to create.

⸻

🎯 Simple Real-Life Analogy

When you click “Open File”, you don’t create the PDF/Word/Excel viewer manually.

The system decides which viewer to create.

⸻

🔥 Simplest Possible Java Example

Step 1: Product
```java
interface Animal {
    void speak();
}
```
Step 2: Concrete Products
```java
class Dog implements Animal {
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat implements Animal {
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}
```
Step 3: Factory Method
```java
class AnimalFactory {

    public static Animal getAnimal(String type) {
        if (type.equals("dog")) {
            return new Dog();
        } else if (type.equals("cat")) {
            return new Cat();
        }

        return null;
    }
}
```
Step 4: Client
```java
public class TestFactory {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a1 = AnimalFactory.getAnimal("dog");
        a1.speak();  // Dog barks

        Animal a2 = AnimalFactory.getAnimal("cat");
        a2.speak();  // Cat meows
    }
}
```

⸻

🧠 Why Is This Factory Method?

Because:

❌ Without factory:
```java
Animal a = new Dog();   // tightly coupled
```
✔ With factory:
```java
Animal a = AnimalFactory.getAnimal("dog");  // loose coupling
```
Client doesn’t know which concrete class is being created.

⸻

⭐ When to Use This Pattern?

	•	When object creation logic changes frequently
	•	When you want to remove “new” from client code
	•	When you want to follow Open/Closed Principle
(add new animals later without touching client code)

⸻

🎯 One-Line Interview Summary

“Factory Method hides the object creation logic and lets a method decide which object to create, improving flexibility and reducing coupling.”

⸻

### Builder Design Pattern

Builder Pattern is used when:

	•	You have a complex object with many fields.
	•	Some fields are optional.
	•	You want to create the object step-by-step in a clean readable way.

Instead of writing messy constructors like:
```java
User u = new User("Akshith", 25, "Hyderabad", null, null, "Software");
```
Builder pattern lets you write:
```java
User u = new User.Builder()
                .name("Akshith")
                .age(25)
                .city("Hyderabad")
                .build();
```
Much cleaner and readable.

⸻

🧩 Simple Example — User Object

❌ Problem Without Builder

You create a User class with many fields → constructor becomes huge → difficult to remember order → prone to mistakes.

⸻

✅ Builder Pattern Implementation

1. Create a class with static Builder
```java
class User {

    private final String name;
    private final int age;
    private final String email;
    private final String city;

    private User(Builder builder) {
        this.name = builder.name;
        this.age = builder.age;
        this.email = builder.email;
        this.city = builder.city;
    }

    // Builder Inner Class
    public static class Builder {
        private String name;
        private int age;
        private String email;
        private String city;

        public Builder name(String name) {
            this.name = name;
            return this;
        }
        public Builder age(int age) {
            this.age = age;
            return this;
        }
        public Builder email(String email) {
            this.email = email;
            return this;
        }
        public Builder city(String city) {
            this.city = city;
            return this;
        }

        public User build() {
            return new User(this);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return name + ", " + age + ", " + email + ", " + city;
    }
}
```

⸻

2. Creating the object (super simple)
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        User user = new User.Builder()
                        .name("Akshith")
                        .age(25)
                        .email("a@gmail.com")
                        .city("Hyderabad")
                        .build();

        System.out.println(user);
    }
}
```

⸻

⭐ Interview-Friendly Summary

👍 When to use Builder Pattern?

	•	Object has many fields, especially optional ones.
	•	You want readable, flexible, immutable object creation.
	•	Avoid telescoping constructors (too many constructor arguments).

👍 Advantages

	•	Clean & readable object creation.
	•	Avoids constructor explosion.
	•	Supports immutability.
	•	You can validate fields before building.

👍 Real Life Examples

	•	StringBuilder in Java
	•	Lombok @Builder
	•	HTTP Request construction:
```java
new HttpRequest.Builder().header().body().build();
``
