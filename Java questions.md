### 1. OOOPs

✅ OOPS Concepts (Object-Oriented Programming) – Interview Explanation

There are four main pillars of OOPS:

	1.	Encapsulation
	2.	Abstraction
	3.	Inheritance
	4.	Polymorphism

I’ll explain each the way you should speak in an interview + small Java examples.

⸻

⭐ 1. Encapsulation

Interview Answer:

Encapsulation means wrapping data and methods into a single unit (a class) and restricting direct access to the data using access modifiers.

It protects data from unintended modifications.

Simple Example
```java
class BankAccount {
    private double balance; // hidden data

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```
👉 balance is private → cannot access directly → controlled using getter/setter.

🎯 Key point to mention: “Encapsulation ensures data protection.”

	•	Data lives inside the class
	•	Only methods inside the class can modify it

This is literally the meaning of encapsulation:

“Wrapping data + methods together as one unit”

⸻

⭐ 2. Abstraction

Interview Answer:

Abstraction means showing only the essential details and hiding unnecessary internal complexity.

Example
```java
abstract class Payment {
    abstract void pay();
}

class CreditCardPayment extends Payment {
    void pay() {
        System.out.println("Payment done using credit card");
    }
}
```

```java
Payment payment = new CreditCardSystem();
payment.pay();
```
You don’t need to know how the credit card works internally.

🎯 Key point: “Abstraction reduces complexity and focuses on what an object does, not how it does it.”

Think of it as:
👉 “I give you the function, but I hide the internal mechanics.”

You only see the idea of paying, not the details

⸻

⭐ 3. Inheritance

Interview Answer:

Inheritance allows one class (child/subclass) to acquire properties and methods of another class (parent/superclass).

It promotes code reusability.

Example
```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal eats");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```
👉 Dog gets eat() method without writing it again.
🎯 Key point: “Inheritance helps with reusability and hierarchical relationships.”

⸻

⭐ 4. Polymorphism

Interview Answer:

Polymorphism means same method name, different behavior.

There are two types:

	•	Compile-time polymorphism → Method Overloading
	•	Runtime polymorphism → Method Overriding

⸻

Compile-time Polymorphism (Overloading)
```java
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) { return a+b; }
    int add(int a, int b, int c) { return a+b+c; }
}
```

⸻

Runtime Polymorphism (Overriding)
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Animal makes sound"); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() { System.out.println("Dog barks"); }
}
```
🎯 Key point: “Polymorphism provides flexibility to use one interface with multiple implementations.”

🔥 Bonus: Additional OOPS Concepts Interviewers Ask

5. Class vs Object
   
	•	Class → Blueprint
	•	Object → Instance of class

⸻

6. Interface
   
	•	100% abstraction (before Java 8)
	•	Can have default and static methods
```java
interface Vehicle {
    void start();
}
```

⸻

7. Abstract Class
   
	•	Cannot be instantiated
	•	Can contain abstract + concrete methods
	•	Used for partial abstraction

⸻

8. Constructor
   
	•	Special method used to initialize objects
	•	Same name as class
	•	No return type

⸻

9. Method Overloading vs Overriding
```
Feature	                 Overloading	    Overriding
Runtime/Compile time	   Compile-time	    Runtime
Parameters	             Different	      Same
Class relation	         Same class	      Parent-child
```

🎯 How to give a perfect OOPS interview answer

When interviewer asks “Explain OOPS”, say:

“OOPS has four major pillars — Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.”
Then explain each in one line, with example if required.

### 2. Exception Hierarchy
```
java.lang.Object
     ↓
  Throwable
   ├── Error (unchecked)
   │      ├── OutOfMemoryError
   │      ├── StackOverflowError
   │      └── etc...
   └── Exception
          ├── RuntimeException (unchecked)
          │       ├── NullPointerException
          │       ├── ArithmeticException
          │       ├── IllegalArgumentException
          │       └── ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
          └── Checked Exceptions
                  ├── IOException
                  ├── SQLException
                  ├── ParseException
                  └── ClassNotFoundException
```

- Exception hierarchy starts from Throwable class.

- Throwable has two children: Error and Exception.

- Errors are unrecoverable and represent issues outside application control.

- Exceptions are recoverable and divided into 

1. Checked exceptions (must be handled) 

These are exceptions that the compiler forces you to handle.

You MUST either:

	•	use try-catch
	•	or throws in method signature

Examples:

	•	IOException
	•	SQLException
	•	FileNotFoundException
	•	ClassNotFoundException


2. Unchecked exceptions (RuntimeException).

These happen during execution due to programming errors. Compiler does NOT force you to catch them.

Examples:

	•	NullPointerException
	•	ArithmeticException
	•	ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
	•	IllegalArgumentException
	•	ClassCastException
